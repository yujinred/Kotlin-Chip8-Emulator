# Kotlin Chip8 Emulator
This is the Chip8 Emulator written in Kotlin

Chip 8 is an interpreted programming language invented in mid-1970s to make video games more easily programmable.

An Emulator basically reinterpret the chip8 game binaries and run them as if your program is a CHIP-8 console.

This Emulator takes heavy inspiration and assistance from  http://www.multigesture.net/articles/how-to-write-an-emulator-chip-8-interpreter/
